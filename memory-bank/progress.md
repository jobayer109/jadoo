# Progress: Jadoo Travel Website

## What Works
- The initial project directory `jadoo` is set up.
- Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created and populated, providing a foundational understanding of the project.
- The `hero-bg.png` image has been implemented as an absolutely positioned `img` tag within `App.jsx` to achieve the "minus position" effect, spanning both the Header and Hero sections as a decorative element, with its positioning and size adjusted.
- A custom `maxWidth` of `1200px` (`container-lg`) has been added to `tailwind.config.js`.
- The `Header` and `HeroSection` (and other future sections) are now wrapped in a global `div` within `App.jsx` that applies `max-w-container-lg`, `mx-auto`, and horizontal padding (`px-4 lg:px-20`).
- The local `max-w` and `px` classes have been removed from the inner `div`s of `Header.jsx` and `HeroSection.jsx`, as these are now handled by the global container.
